          <p className="text-base mt-4 leading-6 text-sm">
          The project was conceived and formulated by BORDA with funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The focus of this project is on promoting integrated and decentralized water and sanitation solutions for small municipalities in the South Asian region. Eight municipalities from three countries in this region, namely India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, were selected for interventions under this project. Therefore, the goal of the project is to contribute to improving the living conditions of people in small towns and reduce the health and environmental risks associated with inadequate water supply and sanitation in this region.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base mt-4 leading-6 text-sm">However, the meso/micro level project objective is to enable the provision of improved municipal water and sanitation services for the disadvantaged population of small towns. Therefore, the projectâ€™s approach is to focus on strengthening municipal capacity for planning and management of integrated and decentralized solutions for water and sanitation challenges faced by small municipalities. Two municipalities were selected in Bangladesh for this project, namely Savar Municipality and Kushtia Municipality. A number of activities were planned and executed under this project, such as planning, design and implementation of various interventions, capacity building, and information dissemination or public awareness raising. Some demonstrative interventions were planned in selected municipalities. A few activities under the project are shown below:
